# CLAUDE.md — PyTorchSim quick reference

Reference notes for working in this repo. The canonical user-facing docs live in `README.md`; this file is a short, opinionated map for development sessions.

## What this repo is

PyTorchSim is a cycle-accurate NPU simulation framework. It plugs into the PyTorch 2 `torch.compile` stack via a custom `npu:0` device (PrivateUse1 backend) and runs three coupled simulators per compiled kernel:

1. **Gem5** (RISC-V) — produces compute-latency tables for the TOG
2. **Spike** — functional simulator that validates generated code correctness
3. **TOGSim** — the project's own cycle-accurate Tile-Operation-Graph simulator that models DRAM (Ramulator2), NoC (BookSim2), L2, systolic arrays, VPU lanes

The pipeline runs in that order on every `torch.compile` invocation; you'll see the three banners (`[Gem5]`, `[Spike]`, `[TOGSim]`) in the log when something is right.

## Repo layout (the parts that actually matter)

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PyTorchSimFrontend/` | Python compiler stack (Inductor backend). `extension_config.py` is the central settings reader; `triton_backend/` is the `npu` codegen route (Inductor's Triton backend + the triton-npu passes); `tog/` turns the MLIR triton-npu emits into TOGSim's trace |
| `PyTorchSimDevice/` | C++ PyTorch backend registering the `npu` device. Built as a pip-installed package via `setup.py`. Based on `torch_openreg` (PrivateUse1 example). Produces `_C.cpython-*.so` |
| `Simulator/simulator.py` | Python drivers: `CycleSimulator` (Gem5), `TOGSimulator` (the cycle-accurate one + multi-tenant context manager). Spike is driven by `triton_backend/functional.py` |
| `Scheduler/scheduler.py` | Poisson arrival generator + scheduling utilities for multi-tenant runs |
| `TOGSim/` | C++ TOGSim source. `src/Simulator.cc`, `Core.cc`, `Dram.cc`, `Interconnect.cc`, `L2Cache.cc`, `Tile.cc`, `TileGraph.cc` are the core models. Externals: ramulator2, booksim, stonneCore, onnx, protobuf, spdlog, yaml-cpp |
| `AsmParser/` | `tog_generator.py`, `onnx_utility.py` — legacy ONNX TOG generation; now used only by the STONNE sparse path (the main path emits a C++ `trace.so` instead) |
| `configs/` | TOGSim hardware configs (YAML). The default is `systolic_ws_128x128_c1_simple_noc_tpuv3.yml`. Naming pattern: `systolic_ws_<size>_c<cores>_<noc>_<target>.yml` |
| `tests/` | Op- and model-level tests organized under `ops/<family>/` (elementwise, reduce, gemm, conv, attention, view, sort, sparsity, misc, fusion), `models/<name>/` (Llama, Mixtral8x7B, DeepSeek, Diffusion, MoE, MLP, MobileNet, Yolov5) plus single-file model tests (test_resnet, test_transformer, test_vit, test_mlp, test_single_perceptron), and `system/` (scheduler, eager, hetro, stonne, vectorops). Shared helper: `tests/_utils.py`. **Which of them pass is `scripts/ci/triton_route_passing.txt`**; the rest are known gaps, swept and reported by `scripts/ci/triton_route_sweep.py --all` |
| `experiments/artifact/` | Paper reproduction scripts (`cycle_validation/run_cycle.sh`, `speedup/run_speedup.sh`) |
| `scripts/` | One-off experiment runners (CompilerOpt, ILS, batch, chiplet, sparsity, stonne, end2end). `build_from_source.sh` builds gem5/llvm/spike |
| `gem5_script/` | gem5 wrapper scripts called by `CycleSimulator` |
| `tpuv4/` | Example SRAM/L2 buffer plans for TPUv4-style persistent cache |
| `togsim_results/` | TOGSim log + trace dump directory (per-run) |
| `outputs/` | Per-run hashed output dirs |

## Running tests

Most tests follow the same pattern: build CPU reference, compile via `torch.compile` on `npu:0`, compare with `torch.allclose` (rtol=atol=1e-4). They all have `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks.

```bash
python tests/ops/elementwise/test_add.py        # vector add (smoke test, fastest)
python tests/ops/gemm/test_matmul.py     # GEMM
python tests/models/test_mlp.py        # MLP forward + backward (training path)
python tests/system/test_scheduler.py  # multi-tenant launch_model
python tests/system/test_eager.py      # eager-fallback registration
```

Run a model from `tests/models/Llama/`, `tests/models/DeepSeek/`, etc. similarly.

**CI coverage:** `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml` is the PR gate. It builds the base image, then the triton-npu toolchain layer (`Dockerfile.tnpu`, pinned by `thirdparty/triton-npu.json`), then the app image, and calls `.github/workflows/pytorchsim_test.yml` once per hardware config. That workflow is a **matrix over `scripts/ci/triton_route_passing.txt`**, one Docker container per test — so adding a test file gates PRs only once it is in that allowlist. Regenerate the allowlist with `python scripts/ci/triton_route_sweep.py --all --update-allowlist` and mirror it into the workflow.

`.github/workflows/triton_npu.yml` runs when the toolchain pin itself moves: triton-npu's own kernels end to end, plus the full coverage sweep (allowlist *and* the rest, reported not gated). Both workflows need `secrets.TNPU_TOKEN` — `PSAL-POSTECH/triton-npu` is private. See `PyTorchSimFrontend/triton_backend/README.md`.

**For fast iteration** (skip functional check):
```bash
export pytorchsim_functional_mode=False   # skips Spike
```

**To read the IR a kernel went through:** every stage is left in
`$TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH/triton_<hash>/` — `01-ttir.mlir`, `02-ttshared.mlir`,
`03-adapted.mlir`, `04-custom.mlir`, then the ELF. The stage a failure did not
reach is the one that owns it.

**To find which op a wrong result first diverges at** (per-kernel CPU cross-check;
sub-option of functional mode). Set `pytorchsim_functional_verify_per_kernel: 1`
in the config YAML, clear the codegen cache, and re-run: each compiled kernel's
output is compared to a CPU golden and the run stops at the first divergent
kernel, naming the op and offending indices.

## Key environment variables

Read in `PyTorchSimFrontend/extension_config.py`:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TORCHSIM_DIR` | `/workspace/PyTorchSim` | repo root |
| `TOGSIM_CONFIG` | `configs/systolic_ws_128x128_c1_simple_noc_tpuv3.yml` | TOGSim hardware YAML |
| `GEM5_PATH` | `/workspace/gem5/build/RISCV/gem5.opt` | gem5 binary |
| `TORCHSIM_LLVM_PATH` | `/usr/bin` | LLVM tool dir |
| `TORCHSIM_LOG_PATH` | `$TORCHSIM_DIR/togsim_results` | where TOGSim logs go |
| `TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH` | `$TORCHSIM_DIR` | misc dumps |
| `TORCHSIM_DEBUG_MODE` | `0` | extra debug |
| `TORCHSIM_BREAKDOWN` | `0` | `1` prints where the run's wall clock went (tnpu compile per stage/pass, Spike, gem5, TOGSim) at exit, and writes `breakdown.json` into the dump path |
| `TNPU_DIR` | `$TORCHSIM_DIR/triton-npu` | triton-npu checkout (stages 1-5) |
| `TNPU_PYTHON` | `sys.executable` | interpreter tnpu runs under (it needs LLVM 23's MLIR bindings, this process holds LLVM 20's) |
| `SRAM_BUFFER_PLAN_PATH` | unset | L2/CMEM persistent-cache tensor plan (Python file with `plan = {...}`) |
| `TOGSIM_DEBUG_LEVEL` | unset | passed to TOGSim `--log_level` |

Note: `TOGSIM_CONFIG` is **overwritten** while inside a `with TOGSimulator(config_path=...)` block (and restored on exit). Compilation reads the same YAML as TOGSim that way.

## TOGSim YAML knobs (the ones I edit most)

Located under `configs/*.yml`:

- `num_cores`, `core_freq_mhz`, `num_systolic_array_per_core`
- `sa_weight_buffer_depth` (per-SA resident weight slots; **must be > 0** — the simulator errors on 0. Raise it to effectively disable the preload run-ahead throttle. Defaults to 2 if the key is absent.)
- `vpu_num_lanes`, `vpu_spad_size_kb_per_lane`, `vpu_vector_length_bits`
- `dram_type` (`ramulator2` | `simple`), `dram_channels`, `dram_freq_mhz`, `ramulator_config_path`
- `icnt_type` (`simple` | `booksim`), `icnt_latency_cycles`, `icnt_freq_mhz`, `icnt_config_path`
- `l2d_type` (e.g., `datacache`), `l2d_config` (AccelSim-format cache config string)
- `pytorchsim_functional_mode` (Spike on/off), `pytorchsim_timing_mode`
- `pytorchsim_functional_verify_per_kernel` (debug: per-kernel CPU cross-check)
- `num_partition` + `partition: {core_0: 0, core_1: 1}` for multi-tenant `stream_index` mapping

## Multi-tenant API (Simulator/simulator.py + scheduler)

```python
from Simulator.simulator import TOGSimulator
from Scheduler.scheduler import poisson_request_generator

with TOGSimulator(config_path=...):
    torch.npu.launch_model(opt_model, x, stream_index=0, timestamp=0)  # timestamp in ns
    torch.npu.synchronize()  # barrier
```

`stream_index` must be a valid queue id from the YAML's `partition` map. `timestamp` is nanoseconds; pass Poisson millisecond times × 1e6.

## Build

- **Docker (recommended):** `docker run -it --ipc=host --name torchsim -w /workspace/PyTorchSim ghcr.io/psal-postech/torchsim-ci:v1.0.1 bash`
- **TOGSim from source:** `cd TOGSim && mkdir -p build && cd build && conan install .. --build=missing && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)`
- **PyTorchSimDevice (Python package):** `cd PyTorchSimDevice && python -m pip install --no-build-isolation -e .`
- **gem5 / LLVM+MLIR / Spike from source:** `bash scripts/build_from_source.sh` (clones to `/workspace/{gem5,llvm-project,riscv-isa-sim}` at the tags pinned in `thirdparty/github-releases.json`, same manifest as the CI docker image).

Conan deps for TOGSim: `boost/1.79.0`, `robin-hood-hashing/3.11.5`, `spdlog/1.11.0`, `yaml-cpp/0.8.0`.

## Where to look for X

- **Adding a new op:** nothing here, usually — Inductor's own Triton lowerings emit the kernel and `triton-npu` lowers it. What lives here is the device-level rewrites: `extension_decomposition.py` (ops with no `npu` kernel), `extension_complex_to_real.py`. GEMM/BMM tile selection: `triton_backend/inductor_templates.py` + `triton_backend/hardware.py`. Kernel source fixups before tnpu sees them: `triton_backend/source_rewrite.py`.
- **Adding a PyTorch device op:** `PyTorchSimDevice/csrc/aten/native/*` (Minimal/Extra split mirrors `torch_openreg`).
- **TOGSim hardware model changes:** `TOGSim/src/{Core,Dram,Interconnect,L2Cache,Tile,TileGraph}.cc` + matching `include/*.h`.
- **TOG generation:** each kernel compiles to a C++ **`trace.so`** (`PyTorchSimFrontend/tog/build_skeleton.py` + `lower_to_emitc.py`) plus a `trace_cycles.tsv` cycle table, driven from `triton_backend/timing.py`; TOGSim turns them into a TileGraph via `trace_to_tilegraph`. `AsmParser/tog_generator.py` + `onnx_utility.py` (the legacy ONNX TOG) remain only for the **STONNE sparse path** (`extension_op.py`).
- **Eager fallback registration:** `torch.npu.register_eager_to_compile([...])` — see `tests/system/test_eager.py`.
- **Per-run results:** `togsim_results/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<hash>>.log` (stats) and `.trace` (instruction trace). The path is also printed at the end of every run.
- **Wrapper codegen path:** printed as `Wrapper Codegen Path = /tmp/torchinductor_<user>/<hash>/...py` — useful for inspecting generated kernel code and tensor names for `SRAM_BUFFER_PLAN_PATH`.

## Gotchas / things I've already learned

- The repo expects `python` to be a Python 3.10+ binary with `torch==2.10.0` (torchvision `0.25.0`, triton `3.6.0`). The frontend extends the PyTorch 2 Inductor stack — pin to this version. 2.10 specifically: it is the first release whose Inductor targets triton 3.6, the version triton-npu is built against. The pins live in `Dockerfile.base`, and editing that file changes the base-image tag automatically (the tag is `thirdparty-<sha256 of thirdparty/github-releases.json + Dockerfile.base>`, see `scripts/ci/thirdparty_base_pin.sh`).
- The default Gem5 path is hard-coded to `/workspace/gem5/build/RISCV/gem5.opt`. Override with `GEM5_PATH` if you build elsewhere.
- `_C.cpython-311-*.so` and `torch_openreg/lib/` are build artifacts — already in `.gitignore`, don't commit.
- TOGSim creates a per-PID FIFO under `/tmp/togsim_fifo_<pid>` for command/event comm; if a previous run crashed and left stale FIFOs, they get cleaned up on the next start, but watch for orphaned processes if you Ctrl-C mid-run.
- Multi-tenant runs **must** use the `with TOGSimulator(...)` context manager — otherwise compile-time `TOGSIM_CONFIG` and runtime config can diverge.
- `pytorchsim_functional_mode` exists as both an **env var** and a **YAML key**; the env var path is via `extension_config.py` while the YAML key is read inside the same module. They should agree.
- "No CUDA runtime is found" warnings on `import torch` are expected — this is a CPU + simulated-NPU environment, not real CUDA.
- **Codegen changes are sticky across runs because of caches.** When iterating on `PyTorchSimFrontend/triton_backend/*`, `PyTorchSimFrontend/tog/*` or triton-npu, clear `$TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH` (default `$TORCHSIM_DIR/outputs/`) before re-running — it holds Inductor's compile cache (`.torchinductor/`, set via `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR` inside `extension_config.get_dump_path()`), the per-source wrapper dirs (`<hash>/`) keyed by `extension_config.get_write_path(src_code)`, and the per-kernel artifacts (`triton_<hash>/`). A tnpu-side fix does NOT move the Inductor hash, so `triton_*` is the one that most often needs deleting; `scripts/clear_codegen_cache.sh` does all three. Otherwise a buggy graph compiled before your fix is replayed verbatim. `togsim_results/` (TOGSim run logs) is cosmetic and not part of the codegen replay path. For parallel worktrees see `docs/worktrees.md`.

## Comments: a three-line docstring per function, and nothing else

The only comment this repo accepts is a docstring of **at most three lines** saying
what the function does. Everything else goes.

**Not allowed:** inline `#` commentary, block comments above a statement, measured
evidence written beside the code it justifies, "WHY THIS IS HERE" paragraphs,
before/after numbers, references to the test that found a bug, TODOs.

**Where that material goes instead:** the commit message. It is versioned, it is
attached to the change that established it, and `git log -S` finds it. A number
that matters is a number in a commit; a number in a comment is a number nobody
can date.

**Applies to what you write and what you touch.** Rewriting a function means its
comments go with the rewrite — do not carry them forward. When you shorten a
docstring past three lines, keep the sentence that says what the function
returns, not the one that says why.

**Module docstrings** follow the same bar: a few lines naming what the file is
for. A diagram of the pipeline is allowed once, in the package `__init__`.

**This is deliberately in tension with `triton-npu`'s rule 3**, which protects
docstrings and comments as the place that backend's reasoning lives. That rule
governs `triton-npu`; this one governs here. Do not carry either across.

## Git workflow (per CONTRIBUTING.md)

- Fork, branch (`feature/<name>`), PR against `develop`, not `main`.
- Commit prefix style observed: `[Frontend] ...`, `[TOGSim] ...`, etc.
- Commit messages: plain text only. No Markdown formatting (no backticks, bold, bullet lists, headings). Avoid Unicode where ASCII works (use `->` not arrows, `--` not em-dashes, straight quotes).

## Ship it — commit and push without being asked

Work that changes behaviour is done when it is **pushed**, not when it runs. Commit
and push in the same turn that finishes it. Do not stop to ask permission for
either; this rule is the permission.

    implement  ->  verify  ->  commit  ->  push

**WHERE IT GOES.** `origin` is `PSAL-POSTECH/PyTorchSim`, the upstream everyone
shares, and it is **not** our destination. Push to the fork:

```bash
git remote add fork git@github.com:student-Jungmin/PyTorchSim.git   # once
git push fork <branch>
```

Reading "push" as "push to origin" puts work on the shared upstream, so check the
remote before pushing rather than trusting whatever `origin` happens to be. A
change spanning repositories is one commit per repository, each to its own remote
— never one commit carrying another repository's work. (`triton-npu` has the
matching rule and the full destination table.)

**VERIFY FIRST, AND SAY WHAT RAN.** "Verified" means the test was executed, not
that the code looks right. For the Triton route that means the affected test
plus the allowlist (`scripts/ci/triton_route_passing.txt`) — and **clear
`outputs/triton_*` and `outputs/.torchinductor` between runs**, or a cached
artifact replays and a fix appears to change nothing. That has already caused one
wrong conclusion. A push whose verification was skipped is a push of an unknown
state.

**PIN `TNPU_DIR` WHEN THE ROUTE IS INVOLVED.** Stages 1-5 live in a separate repo
that someone else may be editing right now, and a pass mid-refactor produces
failures that look like ours (`no lane axis`, bare `NameError`s that vanish on
re-run). Point `TNPU_DIR` at a worktree pinned to a known-good commit so a result
means something.

**WHAT DOES NOT COUNT.** Exploration, scratch files, a half-finished edit, or a
change whose verification failed. Broken work is not pushed — say what failed.

**IF THE PUSH FAILS,** report it and why. Until it lands the work is committed,
not shipped; never present the one as the other.

**A REBUCKETED FAILURE IS NOT A FIX.** Clearing a guard so a test fails deeper is
progress worth committing, but say so in those words rather than counting it as
passing.
