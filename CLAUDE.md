# CLAUDE.md — PyTorchSim quick reference

Reference notes for working in this repo. The canonical user-facing docs live in `README.md`; this file is a short, opinionated map for development sessions.

## What this repo is

PyTorchSim is a cycle-accurate NPU simulation framework. It plugs into the PyTorch 2 `torch.compile` stack via a custom `npu:0` device (PrivateUse1 backend) and runs three coupled simulators per compiled kernel:

1. **Gem5** (RISC-V) — produces compute-latency tables for the TOG
2. **Spike** — functional simulator that validates generated code correctness
3. **TOGSim** — the project's own cycle-accurate Tile-Operation-Graph simulator that models DRAM (Ramulator2), NoC (BookSim2), L2, systolic arrays, VPU lanes

The pipeline runs in that order on every `torch.compile` invocation; you'll see the three banners (`[Gem5]`, `[Spike]`, `[TOGSim]`) in the log when something is right.

## Every operation runs on the NPU — a CPU fallback is a defect

An op with no `npu` kernel does not fail. It **falls back to the CPU**, quietly, and
the model still produces a number. That is the worst shape a defect can have here,
because the run looks like a pass:

- **It is not the thing we are measuring.** Work that ran on the host is absent
  from the TOG, so Gem5/TOGSim price it at zero and Spike never validates it.
  A model whose expert matmuls ran on the CPU has not been run on this NPU, and
  reporting it as supported is reporting someone else's arithmetic.
- **It hides which half is wrong.** When the numbers come out wrong, a graph
  split between device kernels and host calls gives no answer to "where did it
  diverge" — the host half is always right, so every bisect points at us whether
  or not we are at fault.
- **It is silent.** Nothing in the log says "this ran on the CPU". You have to go
  and look.

**HOW TO LOOK.** The generated wrapper names every call it does not compile. Take
the path from `Wrapper Codegen Path` in the log — there is one per graph, so read
them all, not the last one — and count the assignment lines that are not kernels:

```bash
grep -E '^\s+buf[0-9]+ = (torch\.ops|extern_kernels)' "$WRAPPER"   # must be empty
```

**MEASURED, and it is not hypothetical.** Qwen2-MoE, `--preset 2-moe`, same tree
and same device, two transformers:

```
4.51.3   12 graphs   48 npu kernels   0 cpu fallbacks     Test Passed
5.15.0    1 graph    23 npu kernels   4 cpu fallbacks     Max abs diff 1.370
                                      aten.topk, aten.histc,
                                      transformers.grouped_mm_fallback x2
```

5.x rewrote the MoE block to remove the graph breaks (12 graphs -> 1), and paid
for it in fallbacks. The wrong number came with them.

**WHAT TO DO INSTEAD.** A decomposition in `PyTorchSimFrontend/extension_decomposition.py`,
written in aten ops the backend already lowers, so the work stays in the graph.
That file exists for exactly this and says so. Note that casting an operand until
the CPU kernel accepts it is only half the job: the histc decomposition there
still leaves `aten.histc` as an extern call, and its own docstring names the
device-side form it should have been (`(x == bin).sum()` against `arange(bins)` —
one elementwise and one reduce).

**IF YOU CANNOT REMOVE ONE,** say so in those words and name it. A fallback left
in place is a known hole in what "this model runs" means, and it belongs in the
report next to the number it produced — never folded into a pass.

## Repo layout (the parts that actually matter)

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PyTorchSimFrontend/` | Python compiler stack (Inductor backend). `extension_config.py` is the central settings reader; `mlir/` contains MLIR templates per op (gemm, conv, bmm, sdpa, sort, cat, maxpool, …) |
| `PyTorchSimDevice/` | C++ PyTorch backend registering the `npu` device. Built as a pip-installed package via `setup.py`. Based on `torch_openreg` (PrivateUse1 example). Produces `_C.cpython-*.so` |
| `Simulator/simulator.py` | Python drivers: `FunctionalSimulator` (Spike), `CycleSimulator` (Gem5), `TOGSimulator` (the cycle-accurate one + multi-tenant context manager) |
| `Scheduler/scheduler.py` | Poisson arrival generator + scheduling utilities for multi-tenant runs |
| `TOGSim/` | C++ TOGSim source. `src/Simulator.cc`, `Core.cc`, `Dram.cc`, `Interconnect.cc`, `L2Cache.cc`, `Tile.cc`, `TileGraph.cc` are the core models. Externals: ramulator2, booksim, stonneCore, onnx, protobuf, spdlog, yaml-cpp |
| `AsmParser/` | `tog_generator.py`, `onnx_utility.py` — legacy ONNX TOG generation; now used only by the STONNE sparse path (the main path emits a C++ `trace.so` instead) |
| `configs/` | TOGSim hardware configs (YAML). The default is `systolic_ws_128x128_c1_simple_noc_tpuv3.yml`. Naming pattern: `systolic_ws_<size>_c<cores>_<noc>_<target>.yml` |
| `tests/` | Op- and model-level tests organized under `ops/<family>/` (elementwise, reduce, gemm, conv, attention, view, sort, sparsity, misc, fusion), `models/<name>/` (Llama, Mixtral8x7B, DeepSeek, Diffusion, MoE, MLP, MobileNet, Yolov5) plus single-file model tests (test_resnet, test_transformer, test_vit, test_mlp, test_single_perceptron), and `system/` (scheduler, eager, hetro, stonne, vectorops). Shared helper: `tests/_utils.py` |
| `experiments/artifact/` | Paper reproduction scripts (`cycle_validation/run_cycle.sh`, `speedup/run_speedup.sh`) |
| `scripts/` | One-off experiment runners (CompilerOpt, ILS, batch, chiplet, sparsity, stonne, end2end). `build_from_source.sh` builds gem5/llvm/spike |
| `gem5_script/` | gem5 wrapper scripts called by `CycleSimulator` |
| `tpuv4/` | Example SRAM/L2 buffer plans for TPUv4-style persistent cache |
| `togsim_results/` | TOGSim log + trace dump directory (per-run) |
| `outputs/` | Per-run hashed output dirs |

## Running tests

Most tests follow the same pattern: build CPU reference, compile via `torch.compile` on `npu:0`, compare with `torch.allclose` (rtol=atol=1e-4). They all have `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks.

```bash
python tests/ops/elementwise/test_add.py        # vector add (smoke test, fastest)
python tests/ops/gemm/test_matmul.py     # GEMM
python tests/models/test_mlp.py        # MLP forward + backward (training path)
python tests/system/test_scheduler.py  # multi-tenant launch_model
python tests/system/test_eager.py      # eager-fallback registration
```

Run a model from `tests/models/Llama/`, `tests/models/DeepSeek/`, etc. similarly.

**CI coverage:** the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/pytorchsim_test.yml` runs an **explicit allowlist** of `tests/*.py` files (~40 jobs, one Docker container per test). Adding a new file under `tests/` does *not* automatically gate PRs — register it in `pytorchsim_test.yml` if you want CI to exercise it. Conversely, files like `tests/ops/attention/test_gqa.py`, `tests/ops/attention/test_gqa_decode.py`, and `tests/system/test_eager.py` exist in the repo but are *not* in CI, so local validation is the only safety net for them.

The Triton codegen route has its own workflow, `.github/workflows/triton_npu.yml`, kept separate because its toolchain layer is ~1.8 GiB that no other job needs. It builds `torchsim_tnpu_base` (pinned by `thirdparty/triton-npu.json` + `Dockerfile.tnpu`) and needs `secrets.TNPU_TOKEN` plus a toolchain release on the private `PSAL-POSTECH/triton-npu`; see `PyTorchSimFrontend/triton_backend/README.md`.

**For fast iteration** (skip functional check):
```bash
export pytorchsim_functional_mode=False   # skips Spike
```

**To dump intermediate IR while debugging:**
```bash
export TORCHSIM_DUMP_MLIR_IR=1
export TORCHSIM_DUMP_LLVM_IR=1
```

**To find which op a wrong result first diverges at** (per-kernel CPU cross-check;
sub-option of functional mode). Set `pytorchsim_functional_verify_per_kernel: 1`
in the config YAML, clear the codegen cache, and re-run: each compiled kernel's
output is compared to a CPU golden and the run stops at the first divergent
kernel, naming the op and offending indices.

## Key environment variables

Read in `PyTorchSimFrontend/extension_config.py`:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TORCHSIM_DIR` | `/workspace/PyTorchSim` | repo root |
| `TOGSIM_CONFIG` | `configs/systolic_ws_128x128_c1_simple_noc_tpuv3.yml` | TOGSim hardware YAML |
| `GEM5_PATH` | `/workspace/gem5/build/RISCV/gem5.opt` | gem5 binary |
| `TORCHSIM_LLVM_PATH` | `/usr/bin` | LLVM tool dir |
| `TORCHSIM_LOG_PATH` | `$TORCHSIM_DIR/togsim_results` | where TOGSim logs go |
| `TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH` | `$TORCHSIM_DIR` | misc dumps |
| `TORCHSIM_TLS_MODE` | `1` | TLS vs ILS mode |
| `TORCHSIM_USE_TIMING_POOLING` | `0` | lightweight pooling timing |
| `TORCHSIM_DEBUG_MODE` | `0` | extra debug |
| `TORCHSIM_DUMP_MLIR_IR` | `0` | dump MLIR |
| `TORCHSIM_DUMP_LLVM_IR` | `0` | dump LLVM IR |
| `SRAM_BUFFER_PLAN_PATH` | unset | L2/CMEM persistent-cache tensor plan (Python file with `plan = {...}`) |
| `TOGSIM_DEBUG_LEVEL` | unset | passed to TOGSim `--log_level` |

Note: `TOGSIM_CONFIG` is **overwritten** while inside a `with TOGSimulator(config_path=...)` block (and restored on exit). Compilation reads the same YAML as TOGSim that way.

## TOGSim YAML knobs (the ones I edit most)

Located under `configs/*.yml`:

- `num_cores`, `core_freq_mhz`, `num_systolic_array_per_core`
- `sa_weight_buffer_depth` (per-SA resident weight slots; **must be > 0** — the simulator errors on 0. Raise it to effectively disable the preload run-ahead throttle. Defaults to 2 if the key is absent.)
- `vpu_num_lanes`, `vpu_spad_size_kb_per_lane`, `vpu_vector_length_bits`
- `dram_type` (`ramulator2` | `simple`), `dram_channels`, `dram_freq_mhz`, `ramulator_config_path`
- `icnt_type` (`simple` | `booksim`), `icnt_latency_cycles`, `icnt_freq_mhz`, `icnt_config_path`
- `l2d_type` (e.g., `datacache`), `l2d_config` (AccelSim-format cache config string)
- `pytorchsim_functional_mode` (Spike on/off), `pytorchsim_timing_mode`
- `pytorchsim_functional_verify_per_kernel` (debug: per-kernel CPU cross-check)
- `codegen_mapping_strategy`: `heuristic` | `autotune` | `external-then-heuristic` | `external-then-autotune`
- `codegen_external_mapping_file` (key `"M_N_K"` → `{TILE_M, TILE_K, TILE_N}` JSON)
- `codegen_compiler_optimization`: `"all"` | `"none"` | a list from `{fusion, reduction_epilogue, reduction_reduction, prologue, single_batch_conv, multi_tile_conv, subtile}`
- `num_partition` + `partition: {core_0: 0, core_1: 1}` for multi-tenant `stream_index` mapping

## Multi-tenant API (Simulator/simulator.py + scheduler)

```python
from Simulator.simulator import TOGSimulator
from Scheduler.scheduler import poisson_request_generator

with TOGSimulator(config_path=...):
    torch.npu.launch_model(opt_model, x, stream_index=0, timestamp=0)  # timestamp in ns
    torch.npu.synchronize()  # barrier
```

`stream_index` must be a valid queue id from the YAML's `partition` map. `timestamp` is nanoseconds; pass Poisson millisecond times × 1e6.

## Build

- **Docker (recommended):** `docker run -it --ipc=host --name torchsim -w /workspace/PyTorchSim ghcr.io/psal-postech/torchsim-ci:v1.0.1 bash`
- **TOGSim from source:** `cd TOGSim && mkdir -p build && cd build && conan install .. --build=missing && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)`
- **PyTorchSimDevice (Python package):** `cd PyTorchSimDevice && python -m pip install --no-build-isolation -e .`
- **gem5 / LLVM+MLIR / Spike from source:** `bash scripts/build_from_source.sh` (clones to `/workspace/{gem5,llvm-project,riscv-isa-sim}` at the tags pinned in `thirdparty/github-releases.json`, same manifest as the CI docker image).

Conan deps for TOGSim: `boost/1.79.0`, `robin-hood-hashing/3.11.5`, `spdlog/1.11.0`, `yaml-cpp/0.8.0`.

## Where to look for X

- **Adding a new op (Inductor lowering):** `PyTorchSimFrontend/mlir/mlir_ops.py`, `mlir_lowering.py`, plus a new `mlir_<op>_template.py` if it needs its own MLIR template. Decomposition rules: `mlir_decomposition.py`. Scheduling: `mlir_scheduling.py`. Autotune: `mlir_autotune.py`.
- **Adding a PyTorch device op:** `PyTorchSimDevice/csrc/aten/native/*` (Minimal/Extra split mirrors `torch_openreg`).
- **TOGSim hardware model changes:** `TOGSim/src/{Core,Dram,Interconnect,L2Cache,Tile,TileGraph}.cc` + matching `include/*.h`.
- **TOG generation:** the main path compiles each kernel to a C++ **`trace.so`** (`mlir/passes/build_skeleton.py` + `lower_to_emitc.py`) plus a `trace_cycles.tsv` cycle table, which TOGSim turns into a TileGraph via `trace_to_tilegraph`. `AsmParser/tog_generator.py` + `onnx_utility.py` (the legacy ONNX TOG) remain only for the **STONNE sparse path** (`extension_op.py`).
- **Eager fallback registration:** `torch.npu.register_eager_to_compile([...])` — see `tests/system/test_eager.py`.
- **Per-run results:** `togsim_results/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<hash>>.log` (stats) and `.trace` (instruction trace). The path is also printed at the end of every run.
- **Wrapper codegen path:** printed as `Wrapper Codegen Path = /tmp/torchinductor_<user>/<hash>/...py` — useful for inspecting generated kernel code and tensor names for `SRAM_BUFFER_PLAN_PATH`.

## Gotchas / things I've already learned

- The repo expects `python` to be a Python 3.10+ binary with `torch==2.10.0` (torchvision `0.25.0`, triton `3.6.0`). The frontend extends the PyTorch 2 Inductor stack — pin to this version. 2.10 specifically: it is the first release whose Inductor targets triton 3.6, the version triton-npu is built against. The pins live in `Dockerfile.base`, and editing that file changes the base-image tag automatically (the tag is `thirdparty-<sha256 of thirdparty/github-releases.json + Dockerfile.base>`, see `scripts/ci/thirdparty_base_pin.sh`).
- The default Gem5 path is hard-coded to `/workspace/gem5/build/RISCV/gem5.opt`. Override with `GEM5_PATH` if you build elsewhere.
- `_C.cpython-311-*.so` and `torch_openreg/lib/` are build artifacts — already in `.gitignore`, don't commit.
- TOGSim creates a per-PID FIFO under `/tmp/togsim_fifo_<pid>` for command/event comm; if a previous run crashed and left stale FIFOs, they get cleaned up on the next start, but watch for orphaned processes if you Ctrl-C mid-run.
- Multi-tenant runs **must** use the `with TOGSimulator(...)` context manager — otherwise compile-time `TOGSIM_CONFIG` and runtime config can diverge.
- `pytorchsim_functional_mode` exists as both an **env var** and a **YAML key**; the env var path is via `extension_config.py` while the YAML key is read inside the same module. They should agree.
- "No CUDA runtime is found" warnings on `import torch` are expected — this is a CPU + simulated-NPU environment, not real CUDA.
- **Codegen changes are sticky across runs because of caches.** When iterating on `PyTorchSimFrontend/mlir/*` or any code that affects emitted MLIR/wrapper code, clear `$TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH` (default `$TORCHSIM_DIR/outputs/`) before re-running — it holds both Inductor's compile cache (`.torchinductor/`, set via `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR` inside `extension_config.get_dump_path()`) and the per-source-hash MLIR/wrapper dirs (`<hash>/`) keyed by `extension_codecache.get_write_path(src_code)`. Otherwise a buggy graph compiled before your fix is replayed verbatim. `togsim_results/` (TOGSim run logs) is cosmetic and not part of the codegen replay path. For parallel worktrees see `docs/worktrees.md`.

## Git workflow (per CONTRIBUTING.md)

- Fork, branch (`feature/<name>`), PR against `develop`, not `main`.
- Commit prefix style observed: `[Frontend] ...`, `[TOGSim] ...`, etc.
- Commit messages: plain text only. No Markdown formatting (no backticks, bold, bullet lists, headings). Avoid Unicode where ASCII works (use `->` not arrows, `--` not em-dashes, straight quotes).

## Ship it — commit and push without being asked

Work that changes behaviour is done when it is **pushed**, not when it runs. Commit
and push in the same turn that finishes it. Do not stop to ask permission for
either; this rule is the permission.

    implement  ->  verify  ->  commit  ->  push

**WHERE IT GOES.** `origin` is `PSAL-POSTECH/PyTorchSim`, the upstream everyone
shares, and it is **not** our destination. Push to the fork:

```bash
git remote add fork git@github.com:student-Jungmin/PyTorchSim.git   # once
git push fork <branch>
```

Reading "push" as "push to origin" puts work on the shared upstream, so check the
remote before pushing rather than trusting whatever `origin` happens to be. A
change spanning repositories is one commit per repository, each to its own remote
— never one commit carrying another repository's work. (`triton-npu` has the
matching rule and the full destination table.)

**VERIFY FIRST, AND SAY WHAT RAN.** "Verified" means the test was executed, not
that the code looks right. For the Triton route that means the affected test
plus the allowlist (`scripts/ci/triton_route_passing.txt`) — and **clear
`outputs/triton_*` and `outputs/.torchinductor` between runs**, or a cached
artifact replays and a fix appears to change nothing. That has already caused one
wrong conclusion. A push whose verification was skipped is a push of an unknown
state.

**PIN `TNPU_DIR` WHEN THE ROUTE IS INVOLVED.** Stages 1-5 live in a separate repo
that someone else may be editing right now, and a pass mid-refactor produces
failures that look like ours (`no lane axis`, bare `NameError`s that vanish on
re-run). Point `TNPU_DIR` at a worktree pinned to a known-good commit so a result
means something.

**WHAT DOES NOT COUNT.** Exploration, scratch files, a half-finished edit, or a
change whose verification failed. Broken work is not pushed — say what failed.

**IF THE PUSH FAILS,** report it and why. Until it lands the work is committed,
not shipped; never present the one as the other.

**A REBUCKETED FAILURE IS NOT A FIX.** Clearing a guard so a test fails deeper is
progress worth committing, but say so in those words rather than counting it as
passing.
