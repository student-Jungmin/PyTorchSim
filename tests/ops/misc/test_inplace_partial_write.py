"""An in-place op that writes SOME of a buffer must leave the rest alone.

`scatter_`, `index_put_` and `index_copy_` write the positions an index names
and nothing else. Every other element has to survive from the tensor they were
called on. On this backend they do not: the untouched elements come back 0.

    fill 7.0 then scatter_    cpu [7.0, 1.54, 7.0, 7.0, ...]
                              npu [0.0, 1.54, 0.0, 0.0, ...]

WHY IT IS NOT A ZERO TEST, and this is the trap the file exists to hold open.
Filling with 0.0 makes the SAME defect pass -- "the base was copied and it was
zero" and "the base was never copied" are the same sixteen zeros. The fill is
7.0 for that reason and must stay non-zero; a future simplification to
`torch.zeros` retires the test without changing a line of its name.

WHERE IT COMES FROM. Inductor plans this as two kernels and its plan is right:

    ..._full_like_scatter_0(out_ptr0=buf0, xnumel=16)     fills all sixteen
    ..._full_like_scatter_1(..., out_ptr0=buf0, xnumel=4) writes four
        inductor_meta: mutated_arg_names: ['out_ptr0']

The second kernel MUTATES buf0. `mutated_arg_names` is where Inductor says so,
and `triton_backend/kernel_spec.py` deliberately does not read it -- it decides
each argument's role from the stores in the source instead, because the table
overstates on SD1.5 (two kernels list an `in_out_ptr0` they never write, and
believing it produced eight divergence reports about values nothing
materialised).

That reasoning is sound in the direction it was measured and blind in the other.
A store tells you the argument WAS written; it cannot tell you whether all of it
was. `out_ptr0` here is stored to, so it is classified `out`, so the runtime
hands the kernel a fresh buffer rather than the one holding the fill -- and the
twelve positions the scatter never touches keep the fresh buffer's zeros.

`masked_fill_` is here as the boundary rather than for coverage: it is
`where(mask, value, self)`, so it writes EVERY element and reads `self` to do
it. It passes, and it is the reason the defect is about partial writes and not
about in-place ops.

MEASURED 2026-08-14 on transformers 5.15.0, tnpu 983eee4, before any fix:

    scatter_      npu has 12 zeros of 16, the untouched positions exactly
    index_put_    12 of 16
    index_copy_   12 of 16
    masked_fill_  0 of 16, passes

FOUND IN Llama 4, whose MoE router fills with -inf and scatters the top-k
values in, so sigmoid turns the unselected experts into 0. With the base lost,
every expert arrives at 0.5 instead and top-1 routing becomes a blend of all
four. That model reads as "close but wrong", which is what a silently dropped
base looks like from the far end.
