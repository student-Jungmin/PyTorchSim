"""Llama 4 on the Triton codegen route.

Built from ``Llama4TextConfig`` with random weights, so it needs no network and
no checkpoint. Needs transformers 4.51.3 -- the module does not exist at 4.43.

WHAT IS NEW, and it is four things rather than one. Llama 4 is the first break
in the family since 3, and every one of these is absent from test_llama3x:

  MoE in EVERY layer    interleave_moe_layer_step defaults to 1, so unlike
                        Mixtral or Qwen-MoE there is no dense layer to fall back
                        on. Scout routes top-1 of 16 experts and adds a SHARED
                        expert whose output is summed in unconditionally.

  NoPE layers           no_rope_layers is [1,1,1,0,...] -- every fourth layer
                        applies no rotary embedding at all. A decoder where the
                        position information is present in some layers and
                        absent in others has no precedent in this suite, and it
                        is a graph difference rather than a constant one.

  QK norm               use_qk_norm puts an RMSNorm on q and k after the rotary,
                        per head rather than per hidden.

  chunked attention     attention_chunk_size bounds how far back a token may
                        attend, which is a second mask shape beside the causal
                        one.

The presets keep all four. Experts are scaled DOWN -- 4 rather than Scout's 16 --
on the same argument tests/models/Qwen/test_qwen.py makes for its MoE presets:
what is unproven is the routing and the combine, and those do not change with
the expert count. Layers stay at 4 because that is the shortest run that
contains a NoPE layer; `scout` names its own no_rope_layers to get one in two.

    source /workspace/tnpu-env.sh
    python tests/models/Llama/test_llama4.py --preset small

MEASURED 2026-08-14 on transformers 5.15.0, tnpu 983eee4, --preset small:
147,874,816 parameters, 31 kernels, 4.7684e-06, 8m00s. All four guards green --
4/4 MoE layers, no_rope_layers [1,1,1,0], experts=4 top-1, qk_norm, chunk=32.

Fifteen ops run eager: 11 `fill_` and 4 `topk`. The complex arithmetic used to
be the bulk of that list -- 7 `view_as_complex`, 7 `mul.out`, 6 `view_as_real`,
twenty calls leaving the simulator -- and `extension_complex_to_real` (84ad277)
now keeps all of it in the graph. That pass was written and measured against
DeepSeek-V2's rope, and it covers this one unchanged: Llama 4's complex path
uses no op outside the set it already knew. The kernel count went 30 -> 31 as
the complex work became a kernel rather than a fallback.

SCOPE, AND IT IS A REAL LIMIT rather than a shrug. The gate runs `small`, 1024
hidden. `--preset scout` builds Scout's real width (5120 hidden, 40/8 heads,
1,394,672,640 parameters), passes all four guards, compiles 30 kernels, and
then DIES IN SPIKE at kernel 19:

    Kernel store segfault @ 0x0000000000000000        a0 0000000000000000
                                                      s4 0000000050000000

That is not this model's arithmetic. s4 is 0x50000000 = 1,342,177,280, exactly
the byte size of the MoE expert stack (4 x 5120 x 8192 x 2 f32), and a0 is the
null it was told to store through. tnpu's wrapper.py sizes every buffer

    padded = ((nbytes + 63) // 64) * 64 * 2

-- doubled, to keep a DMA tail write off the heap -- so the 1.25 GiB argument is
requested as 2.5 GiB, `calloc` returns NULL, and nothing checks it. The DMA tail
is bounded by a tile, not by the tensor, so the factor is the thing to look at
first; the missing NULL check is why this reads as a segfault instead of "1.25
GiB allocation failed". Until that moves, Llama 4's claim here is a shape claim,
not a width claim -- unlike test_llama3x.py, which gates the real 8B block.

THREE WALLS, IN THE ORDER THEY FELL, because none of them was visible until the
one before it moved.

  atomic_add      On transformers 4.51.3 this stopped at kernel 28,
                  ..._scatter_add_view_28, with "unexpected op in ptr sequence"
                  -- triton_shared's PtrAnalysis meeting `tt.atomic_rmw`, an op
                  it has no arm for. No coverage kernel in triton-npu calls
                  `tl.atomic_*` at all, and the two that look like they do
                  (dl/moe_combine, dl/embedding_grad_scatter_add) both AVOID
                  atomics on purpose, one with a read-modify-write and one by
                  resolving the collision as a predicate. 5.15.0's MoE combine
                  no longer emits it.

  polar           The complex-valued rotary. Llama 4 builds its frequencies as
                  complex numbers, which no other model in this suite does, and
                  the strides arrived transposed against what the op expects:
                  "expected size 32==32, stride 64==1 at dim=1". Fixed in
                  PyTorchSim 3fdcab7, which lowers `polar` to a view over a real
                  pair so it never leaves the graph. Adopting torch's own
                  decomposition verbatim does NOT work -- its body mutates
                  views and trips assert_functional_graph.

  the lost base   With polar out of the way the model compiled and answered
                  WRONG, max abs diff 1.31 against a 4.77e-06 tolerance. Not the
                  complex rewrite: with that pass off the diff is 1.3095997
                  against 1.3095998, the same answer with complex computed on
                  the CPU. It was the MoE router. It fills with -inf and
                  scatters the top-k logits in, and `_roles` classified that
                  scattered-into buffer `out` rather than `inout`, so the kernel
                  got a fresh buffer and every unselected expert arrived at 0
                  instead of -inf. sigmoid turned those into 0.5 and top-1
                  routing became a blend of all four. Fixed in PyTorchSim
                  8d8e2ed; tests/ops/misc/test_inplace_partial_write.py pins it.

The third one is the reason this file says what the model does rather than only
what it builds. A router that blends four experts instead of choosing one still
produces a plausible tensor of the right shape, and only a numeric comparison
against the reference calls it.
