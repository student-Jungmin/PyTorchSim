"""Gemma 1, 2 and 3 (text) on the Triton codegen route.

Built from the ``transformers`` configs with random weights, so it needs no
network and no checkpoint.  The models are ``transformers``' own
``GemmaForCausalLM`` / ``Gemma2ForCausalLM`` / ``Gemma3ForCausalLM`` -- nothing
here reimplements a block, so what the test exercises is the shipped module,
not our reading of it.  One file covers all three generations because they are
deltas on one block, the way the Qwen file covers its family.

HOW DEEP A PRESET RUNS IS DECIDED BY THE REPEATING UNIT, not by taste:

  * Gemma 1's unit is ONE layer -- 18 of them at 2B, 28 at 7B, all identical.
    A preset runs one.  What depth would add is the block-to-block seam, which
    the Llama and GPT-2 tests already cross.
  * Gemma 2 alternates local and global attention, ``is_sliding = not
    (layer_idx % 2)``, so its unit is TWO layers.  A one-layer preset would run
    the local variant and never the global one.
  * Gemma 3 runs FIVE local layers to one global, ``is_sliding =
    (layer_idx + 1) % sliding_window_pattern`` with the pattern at 6, so its
    unit is SIX layers.  That is affordable only because Gemma 3's smallest
    shipped text model is narrow (1152 hidden), which is why ``3-1b`` is the
    preset that carries the pattern and ``3-4b`` carries width alone.

WHAT EACH GENERATION ADDS, and why it needs its own preset:

  * 1  the baseline block -- see the Gemma-1 section below.
  * 2  LOCAL/GLOBAL ALTERNATION and LOGIT SOFT-CAPPING.  Attention logits are
       capped at 50 and the final logits at 30, each as
       ``tanh(x / cap) * cap`` -- a tanh on the [batch, heads, seq, seq] score
       tensor and again on [batch, seq, vocab].  Nothing else in this suite
       caps.  Gemma 2 also adds a SECOND PAIR of RMSNorms per layer
       (``pre_feedforward_layernorm`` / ``post_feedforward_layernorm``, on top
       of input/post_attention), so the block carries four norms where Llama
       and Gemma 1 carry two.
  * 3  TWO ROPE BASES IN ONE MODEL.  Local layers use ``rope_local_base_freq``
       (10000) and global layers ``rope_theta`` (1000000), materialised as two
       separate rotary modules (``rotary_emb`` and ``rotary_emb_local``) whose
       cos/sin the layers pick between.  Every other model here has exactly one
       inv_freq.  Soft-capping is gone again (both caps are None).  Gemma 3
       also applies q_norm/k_norm over head_dim -- that is NOT new, Qwen 3
       contributes it -- so the presets do not claim it.

THE SLIDING WINDOW IS SCALED DOWN WITH seq, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING.  Both
shipped configs use a 4096-token window; at seq 32 ``torch.tril(..., diagonal=
-4096)`` selects NOTHING, so the local layers become byte-identical to the
global ones and the alternation the presets exist to test evaporates.  Measured:
window 4096 at seq 32 masks 0 elements, window 8 masks 300.  So window is a
preset field, ``_assert_character`` refuses any preset whose window is not
strictly inside its seq, and a "Gemma 2 passes" that never built a band mask
cannot happen quietly.

WHAT GEMMA 1 ADDS over the Llama/Qwen blocks already in this suite:

  * RMSNorm SCALED BY (1 + w).  ``GemmaRMSNorm`` holds a zero-initialised
    weight and applies ``x * (1 + w)``, upcasting to float32 first and casting
    back after -- every other RMSNorm in this suite is ``x * w``.  The offset
    is not cosmetic: with w near zero the Llama form collapses the activation
    and the Gemma form passes it through, so a backend that folded the two
    together would fail here and nowhere else.
  * EMBEDDING SCALED BY sqrt(hidden_size).  The embedding output is multiplied
    by a scalar (55.4 at 7B) before the first block.  A broadcast multiply of a
    Python-side constant against the full [batch, seq, hidden] activation.
  * head_dim 256 -- TWICE the largest in this suite, which tops out at 128
    (Llama 3, Qwen 2.5/3).  It doubles the reduction length inside attention
    and the tile the systolic array sees for q/k/v.
  * MQA at 2B: ``num_key_value_heads=1``, so n_rep = 8 and ONE kv head is
    broadcast across every query head.  The suite's GQA repeats are 1, 2, 3, 4,
    6, 7 and 8-into-8; a single kv head is the degenerate end none of them
    reach, and it makes k_proj/v_proj narrow (2048 -> 256) where q_proj is
    square.
  * GeGLU.  The gated MLP uses ``gelu_pytorch_tanh``; every gated MLP in this
    suite is SwiGLU (silu).  GPT-2 contributes a gelu, but an ungated one.
  * vocab 256000 with a tied lm_head -- the largest vocab in the suite.  The
    presets scale vocab down (it is a cost axis, not a character axis) but keep
    the tie, which is what makes the vocab projection share the embedding.

WHY 2B AND 7B ARE BOTH HERE.  They are not the same block at two widths:

  * 2B is MQA (kv_heads 1) and heads * head_dim == hidden (8 * 256 == 2048).
  * 7B is MHA (kv_heads 16) and heads * head_dim != hidden (16 * 256 == 4096
    against 3072 hidden), so q_proj is not square and o_proj shrinks 4096 ->
    3072.

Dropping either one drops a claim.  ``_assert_character`` cashes every claim
above against the built model, so a preset cannot pass while proving nothing.

MEASURED ON TRANSFORMERS 5.15.0, 2026-08-14, triton-npu develop c6e9d7f,
functional-only config (Spike decides correctness; no cycles are reported).
Every preset ran with its OWN TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH: the kernel cache is keyed on
Triton source text alone, and a bmm template's text is identical for two presets
that differ only in head COUNT, so a shared dump lets one preset's kernel answer
for another's.

`rg-2b` is Griffin, marked G: a linear recurrence with a temporal conv1d where
the other families put attention, and two layers in three are that recurrence.
Its diff is a decade above the rest of the file, which is where a scan over the
sequence would put it, but that is an observation and not a measured account.
It reaches the backend at all because of two fixes made the same day -- torch's
own conv1d_to_conv2d registered so the conv is lowered rather than sent to an
extern kernel, and triton-npu d846ff4 so the fused block's 24 arguments fit the
2048 bytes riscv-pk gives a guest's argv. Either one missing and it stops before
a kernel runs.

GEMMA 1 IS BIT-IDENTICAL ACROSS THE BUMP -- same kernels, same last digit, at
all three widths.  Gemma 2 and 3 keep passing but fuse differently, and where a
fusion boundary moves the accumulation order moves with it, so the last digit
drifts in both directions.  The tolerance is 1e-2 and these are float32 noise;
none of it is a regression.

THE TWO MULTIMODAL PRESETS ARE.  They passed at 4.51.3 and fail here, and the
cause is not the version-agnostic accessors below.  5.15.0 stops fusing the
splice into its neighbours: what was
``..._embedding_eq_expand_masked_scatter_unsqueeze_42`` at 4.51.3 is a
standalone ``masked_scatter`` kernel here, holding two <32 x i64> index vectors
at once, and llc answers that with a ``vs2r.v`` -- a whole register GROUP on the
stack.  The tnpu pipeline refuses a spilled kernel because there is no working
spill path behind it; Spike would die at the next stage on an invalid spad
address.  Both families reach the identical 25/38 despite different towers and
different text widths, which is what says the stop belongs to the shared splice
path rather than to either model.  The index range is 32 x 256, so i32 would
carry it -- narrowing it is the open lead and is NOT done here.

"kernels" is unique / executed.  Three things the counts say:

  * GEMMA 2 COSTS KERNELS, NOT WIDTH.  2-27b-scalar compiles 20 unique kernels
    at 11.5M parameters where Gemma 1's 302M 7b compiles 15.  The extra work is
    per-layer and shape-independent: two more RMSNorms and two tanh soft-caps.
  * LOCAL AND GLOBAL ATTENTION COMPILE SEPARATELY.  2-2b runs two layers and
    lands at 24 unique against 38 executed -- the pair does not share one
    attention kernel, which is the observable consequence of the alternation.
  * DEPTH REUSES.  3-1b executes 100 kernels for 25 unique across six layers:
    the five local layers share, and the global layer's different rope base
    earns it its own.  That is the argument for running exactly one period and
    not two.

2b compiles one MORE kernel than 7b despite being under half the size: MQA
broadcasts its single kv head where 7B's MHA does not, and that broadcast does
not fuse into either neighbour.

Nothing here was blocked when it was written -- all three generations ran end to
end on the first attempt against this pin, with no backend change.  These
numbers are a floor to regress against, not a fix.
