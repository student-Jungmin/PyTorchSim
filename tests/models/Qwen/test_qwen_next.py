"""The Qwen families transformers 5.x added, on the Triton codegen route.

`test_qwen.py` covers the four families that existed when it was written --
qwen2, qwen2_moe, qwen3, qwen3_moe -- plus the two VL towers in
`test_qwen_vl.py`.  transformers 5.15.0 ships nine more Qwen model types, and
this file is the seven of them that build from a config alone and run.  Same
shape as the others: random weights, no network, no checkpoint, no remote code,
one layer per family.

WHAT EACH ONE ADDS, and why it is not covered by the four already here:

  * qwen3_vl / qwen3_vl_moe   Qwen3's block under a vision tower.  The LANGUAGE
                              half is what this file runs; the vision tower
                              needs pixel inputs and is `test_qwen_vl.py`'s
                              shape of problem, not this one's.
  * qwen3_5 / qwen3_5_moe     A LINEAR-ATTENTION line.  The recurrence unrolls
                              per position, so seq 16 lowers to 121 and 134
                              kernels against the 19 a Qwen3 layer takes --
                              that ratio is the thing this preset pins, and it
                              is why the seq axis matters here more than width.
                              It also puts a Conv1d in the block, which needs
                              inductor_templates' conv1d-to-conv2d registration
                              or it falls to an extern kernel this device has
                              no implementation for.
  * qwen3_next                Hybrid attention -- linear layers interleaved with
                              full ones -- so its cache is not an Attention
                              cache and `use_cache=False` is required to build
                              one at all.  132 kernels.
  * qwen2_audio / qwen3_asr   Audio models.  `--audio` feeds a mel spectrogram
                              so the ENCODER runs -- conv stack, windowed
                              attention, projector -- and the result is spliced
                              into the text sequence.  Without it these run on
                              text alone (17 kernels), which says nothing about
                              the encoder.  See `run_audio` for the four config
                              knobs that are not free to shrink.

WHAT IS NOT COVERED, and it is a large half:

  * THE OMNI PAIR.  qwen2_5_omni and qwen3_omni_moe are a thinker plus a talker
    under one config, and the thinker cannot be constructed on its own: it reads
    `vision_start_token_id`, which no config in the pair carries until the parent
    builds it.  Building the parent means building the talker's vocoder too.
  * DEPTH.  One layer, as everywhere in this suite.
  * WIDTH.  These are shape claims at a small width, not the real ones.

VERIFIED (2026-08-14, transformers 5.15.0, one layer, seq 16):

    qwen3_vl       5.96e-07     qwen3_5       2.38e-07   121 kernels
    qwen3_vl_moe   7.15e-07     qwen3_5_moe   1.49e-07   134 kernels
    qwen2_audio    7.15e-07     qwen3_next    2.38e-07   132 kernels
    qwen3_asr      7.15e-07

    --audio        qwen2_audio  1.31e-06   168s   32 mel x 32 frames,   8 tokens
                   qwen3_asr    1.19e-06   216s   32 mel x 100 frames, 13 tokens

    The two audio figures are max abs diff read off the same shapes at the same
    seed before this ran as a test; `test_result` itself reports only the
    verdict, and what it reported was Passed at rtol 1e-2 / atol 1e-4.

THE AUDIO PATH IS NOT GATED YET, and the reason is a pin rather than a result.
Its `..._eq_masked_scatter_unsqueeze_22` needs triton-npu's
`fix/p14-cross-loop-registers` -- the pass there sized a loop from its own body
while a value held across it kept registers llc then had to spill, which spike's
sp remap cannot store.  Gating this before `thirdparty/triton-npu.json` carries
that commit turns CI red on a fix that has landed nowhere it can see.

qwen3_vl_moe and qwen3_5_moe both route through
`extension_counting_sort`, which is what keeps their `torch.sort` from lowering
to a bitonic network the scratchpad cannot hold -- so this file is also what
stops that rewrite from being a one-model patch.

        qwen3_asr wants a multiple of `n_window * 2`.  Read it off the config

        post-CNN length is `... + (frames // (n_window * 2)) * 13` with the 13
        WRITTEN IN -- it is the conv stack's output for a 100-frame chunk and

        attention by 13 while the CNN handed it 2, so `torch.split` refuses:
        "split_sizes to sum exactly to 2 ... but got split_sizes=[13]".
