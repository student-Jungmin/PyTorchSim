"""Qwen 1.5 / 2 / 2.5 / 3 and the two MoE lines, on the Triton codegen route.

Built from the ``transformers`` configs with random weights, so it needs no
network and no checkpoint.  One file covers every Qwen version because the
versions are shapes and small deltas on one block, not separate models -- and
a Qwen model is that block repeated, so a preset runs one layer.  What depth
would add is the block-to-block seam, which the Llama and GPT-2 tests already
cross.

WHAT EACH VERSION ADDS, and why it needs its own preset:

  * 1.5      QKV bias.  Every q/k/v projection in the Qwen2 module carries a
             bias term (``bias=True`` is hardcoded in ``Qwen2Attention``), which
             no Llama, GPT-2-style-fused or BERT path in this suite emits: it is
             an addmm epilogue on the three projections that feed attention.
             1.5-1.8B is also MHA (n_rep = 1) and ties lm_head.
  * 2        GQA with n_rep = 6 at 1.5B.
  * 2.5      n_rep = 7 at the real 7B width -- 3584 hidden, head_dim 128,
             SwiGLU 18944.  Seven is the first ODD PRIME repeat in the suite
             (Llama 3.2-3B contributed 3).  2.5 is otherwise config-identical
             to 2: same ``Qwen2ForCausalLM``, so the preset is a width claim.
  * 2-moe    Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B's block: routed experts PLUS a shared expert
             whose contribution is scaled by a sigmoid gate, which DeepSeek-V3's
             MoE (shared experts, no gate on them) and Mixtral (no shared
             expert) both miss.  ``norm_topk_prob`` is False here, so the
             routing weights are NOT renormalised after top-k.
  * 3        q_norm / k_norm: an RMSNorm applied per head over head_dim, after
             the projection and before rope.  A reduction of length head_dim
             sitting inside attention, which nothing else in the suite has.
             Bias is gone again (attention_bias=False).
  * 3-0.6b   head_dim DECOUPLED from hidden_size: 16 heads x 128 = 2048 against
             1024 hidden, so q_proj is not square and the o_proj shrinks.  Every
             other attention in this suite has heads * head_dim == hidden.
  * 3-moe    Qwen3's MoE: routed experts only, no shared expert, and
             ``norm_topk_prob`` True.  The counterpart to 2-moe -- the pair is
             what makes the shared-expert path a tested difference rather than
             an assumed one.

Qwen 1 (``QWenLMHeadModel``, 2023) is deliberately absent: it ships only as
remote code on the Hub, it is not in ``transformers``, and its block is the
1.5 block with a different rope/ln arrangement.  Adding it would mean
trust_remote_code and a network fetch in CI for no new kernel.

``_assert_character`` cashes each claim above against the built model.  Without
it a preset can pass while proving nothing -- "qwen3 runs" is worth nothing if
q_norm silently did not exist.

    * moe_intermediate_size; both MoE presets run 8 experts, top-4.

THE WALL CLOCKS ARE UPPER BOUNDS, not a measurement of this backend: four other
model runs (Gemma, Kimi, DeepSeek) shared the machine throughout, so these are
not comparable with the Llama 3.x table's.  The kernel counts and the diffs are.

Two things the table says that the presets alone do not:

  * MOE COSTS KERNELS, NOT WIDTH.  36 and 37 kernels against 19 for a dense
    block of the same shape, because eight experts lower to eight separate
    MLPs -- the routing picks between them, it does not batch them.  That is
    the shape of the cost to expect when the real 60 and 128 expert counts are
    tried, and it is why the expert count is the axis that got scaled down.
  * WIDTH DOES NOT ADD KERNELS.  19 at 1536 hidden and 19 at 4096, the same
    observation test_llama3x.py made across a 4x width.

WHAT THIS FOUND: one defect, in this repo rather than in Qwen.  Qwen3's q_norm
fuses with rope into a PERSISTENT reduction over head_dim, and 27 live
scratchpad tiles put it 1625120 bytes/lane over a 131072 budget.  The scratchpad
retry in `triton_backend/codecache.py` answered that by halving R0_BLOCK, which
a persistent reduction writes into its own body and never reads from the launch
-- so 128, 8 and 1 all measured the identical overflow and the kernel was
refused.  `_shrink_tile` now moves only a block the kernel actually takes as an
argument, and falls back to XBLOCK when a reduction takes none; 3-moe compiles
on the first retry.  Nothing about Qwen was wrong.

# THE GATE: what the sweep runs when it runs this file with no arguments.
#
# TWO PRESETS, NOT ONE, because one Qwen preset cannot carry the file's claim.
# Every other model here has a single architecture and gates a width; this file
# gates a family whose members differ from each other, so the gate has to
# straddle the difference:
#
#   3-8b    Qwen3 at its real 8B width -- q_norm/k_norm, head_dim 128, no bias.
#   2-moe   the Qwen2-family QKV BIAS (Qwen2MoeAttention hardcodes it, exactly
#           as Qwen2Attention does) AND the routed + shared-expert MoE block.
#
# Between them: both attention variants, both bias conventions, the real Qwen3
# width, and the MoE routing. 519s measured for this no-argument run, against a
# 1800s sweep timeout and an allowlist that already carries an 11-minute entry.
#
# What the gate therefore does NOT hold, and a command holds instead:
#   --preset 2.5-7b   n_rep=7 at the real 7B width
#   --preset 3-moe    Qwen3-MoE's no-shared-expert block
#   --preset 3-0.6b   head_dim decoupled from hidden_size
# Adding all five would put the entry past 20 minutes for coverage that moves
# with the same block the gate already runs.
