"""Qwen2-VL and Qwen2.5-VL on the Triton codegen route.

Built from the ``transformers`` configs with random weights: no checkpoint, no
network, and no image file -- the pixel input is the patch tensor the processor
would have produced, which is what the model actually consumes.

A VL model is not the text model with an encoder bolted on the front, and the
three things that make it different are the three this file exists for:

  * THE PATCHES ARE A FLAT SEQUENCE, not a grid.  ``pixel_values`` arrives as
    (num_patches, channels * temporal_patch * patch * patch) with the layout
    carried separately in ``image_grid_thw``, so the tower's first op is a
    3D convolution over a sequence rather than a 2D one over an image.

  * M-ROPE.  ``rope_scaling={"mrope_section": [...]}`` splits head_dim/2 into
    three bands -- temporal, height, width -- and each band takes its position
    from a different axis.  Inductor lowers the band selection to
    ``triton_helpers.select_one``, which is why kernel_spec vendors it.

  * MASKED_SCATTER.  The image embeddings are spliced into the text sequence
    at the image-token positions.  Inductor lowers that to a running index --
    a ``tl.associative_scan`` carried across the reduction loop in int64 --
    used as a gather offset.  THAT is what blocked this file: triton_shared's
    ``tts.get_structured_state`` accepted only i32 tensors while the prepass
    that builds it wraps every int tensor, so the whole kernel was refused.
    Fixed in triton_shared (fix/structured-state-i64-offsets); with the old
    binary this test stops at stage 3 and says so.

``_assert_character`` cashes each of those against the built model, and the
image is proved to REACH the output rather than assumed to: the same model is
run twice with different pixels and the logits must differ.  Without that a
tower that quietly contributed nothing would pass.

MEASURED 2026-08-13.  The `tiny` rows are triton-npu develop 3434608; the `2b`
row also needs the triton-npu fix below (fix/p13-replicate-one-lane).  Both need
triton_shared with the i64 fix:

    2b      Qwen2-VL     1536        1280      64  114,652,928    4.2021e-06*
    2b      Qwen2.5-VL   1536        1280      64  114,676,408    4.3809e-06*

    * with --eager-splice; see below.

WHAT THE SIZED PRESETS NEEDED, since none of it is in this file.  Two toolchain
changes and one flag, in the order they were hit:

  triton_shared   `tts.get_structured_state` accepted i32 offset tensors while
                  the prepass that builds it wraps every int tensor, so the
                  splice's int64 running index failed the whole kernel.
                  Widened to the i32-or-i64 constraint that file already has.

  triton-npu      `_replicate_computed_row` chose `replicate_axes` by matching
                  shapes, and a rank-2 row against a rank-4 tile matched none
                  of its three arms -- so transformers' image-token COUNT (not
                  the model's arithmetic: the check that placeholders match
                  embeddings) was refused by bank_vectorize with "one operand
                  ... is in a single bank (ONE_LANE) while another is banked
                  across the lanes on iteration dim 0 of extent 128".  The
                  correspondence was in the operand's map; it reads it there
                  now.  Qwen2-Audio's audio-token count is the same shape.

  --eager-splice  at the sized presets Inductor lowers the splice's cumsum as a
                  DECOUPLED-LOOKBACK split scan, where one block spins on
                  another's published state.  This route compiles one ELF and
                  walks the grid in its own wrapper, so there is no such
                  channel.  The flag declines the feature that picks that form
                  and the op falls back to eager -- right values, no kernel.

`tiny` is the default because it needs none of the third: its scan is one
block, so the splice COMPILES there, and it exercises every structural claim
above.  `7b` is the same shapes at the 7B text width and is not measured here.
