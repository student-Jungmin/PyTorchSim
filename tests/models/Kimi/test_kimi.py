"""The Kimi line, end to end on the Triton codegen route, oldest rung first.

Moonshot's open models are one architecture that grew, so this file is a LADDER
rather than a model: each rung is the previous one plus something this backend
has not had to do before, and a rung is only worth climbing once the one below
it passes.

`moonlight` is the LM half of the first Kimi-named release: Kimi-VL's language
model IS this network, and both load DeepSeek's own remote code
(`modeling_deepseek.py`, model_type deepseek_v3). Starting a rung below the
first Kimi is deliberate -- it separates "MLA + MoE on this backend" from
"MoonViT on this backend", and the vision rung cannot be read until the text one
does.

Weights are random from the config (`--init-mode config-random`), so no
checkpoint is downloaded -- only the config and the remote modeling file. The
presets shrink hidden_size, layer count and expert count; they do NOT shrink the
MLA head dims (qk_nope 128 / qk_rope 64 / v 128, kv_lora_rank 512), because
those are the shapes the layout work is about.

Judgement is spike's, against the same model on CPU. Run it with the Triton
route on and timing off:

    source /workspace/kimi-env.sh
    python tests/models/Kimi/test_kimi.py --rung moonlight --preset tiny

WHERE THE LADDER STANDS. The environment moved mid-bringup -- transformers
4.43.4 -> 4.51.3 and triton-npu's p01/p11/p13/p16 refactors -- so the rows say
which side of that they were measured on. The new baseline is the one to
extend; the old rows stay until each is re-measured, because a number whose
compiler is gone is a number about nothing.

  BASELINE: transformers 4.51.3, triton-npu develop-e2e-kimi at the develop
  merge (b28808b..), PyTorchSim develop-e2e-kimi ac39991.

    rung       preset  kernels  goldens  max diff      time
    moonlight  tiny        51      430   7.1526e-07    ~5 min

  BEFORE IT: transformers 4.43.4, triton-npu 3434608, PyTorchSim 204ec14.

    rung       preset  kernels  goldens  max diff      time
    moonlight  tiny        49      408   8.0466e-07    ~5 min
    moonlight  small       58      416   1.0729e-06    ~9 min
    moonlight  medium     157        -   2.0266e-06    ~43 min
    kimi-vl    tiny        93      909   8.3447e-07    ~8 min

The two kernels and 22 goldens tiny gained across that move are not attributed:
both the compiler and transformers changed between the runs, and one run cannot
tell them apart. Pin PSTO_DIR at a pre-merge worktree to split them if it ever
matters.

`goldens` is with `pytorchsim_functional_verify_per_kernel` on, so it is every
realized Spike buffer compared against a CPU golden at 1e-4 and not just the
logits -- 408 of them across 17 graphs, none divergent.

The tolerance here is 1e-3 against a measured 8e-07. It is deliberately NOT the
3e-1 the DeepSeek test carries: that number was picked for fp16 and it would
hide two orders of magnitude of drift on this fp32 path.

What tiny already crosses, and what therefore needs no separate claim: MLA's
asymmetric head (q is nope+rope wide, v is not), the kv_lora down-projections,
the RoPE apply kernel (`cat`/`index`/`neg`/`slice` -- the shape that stops
DeepSeek-V3 in Spike), the sigmoid gate's topk, and the routed-expert loop.
