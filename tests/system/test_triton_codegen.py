    THIS CHECK USED TO REQUIRE THE OPPOSITE and said so: "A reduction must fail
    LOUDLY, not compile into wrong numbers ... tnpu has no lane-aware reduction
    ... When the lane path lands, this is the test to delete." It landed, from an
    unexpected direction: nothing in tnpu changed, but Inductor now emits a
    PERSISTENT reduction wherever this backend's block covers the extent
    (inductor_templates._persist_a_reduction_that_fits_one_tile), and a
    reduction that finishes inside one tile never crosses a lane -- which was the
    whole reason the old form could not be lowered.

    Deleting it outright would give up the thing it was really guarding, which is
    not "does this stop" but "are the numbers real". So it is turned around and
    asks that instead.

    AND IT ASKS IT OF dim 0 TOO, which used to be the axis that stopped. It did
    not stop for being dim 0: Inductor hands the reduction down correctly either
    way (dim 0 gives xnumel 64 against r0_numel 128, dim 1 the reverse) and
    `fixed_config_for` gave BOTH XBLOCK = 128 without looking at the numel, so
    dim 0 got a tile twice its iteration space and the surplus became a mask
    that stage 4 refused. Blocks are clamped to their numel now, and this checks
    the axis that clamping fixed as well as the one that never needed it.
