# Create a sibling git worktree for parallel work and wire up per-worktree env.
#
# Container-dedicated: assumes the ghcr.io/psal-postech/torchsim-ci container
# layout. Shared binaries (gem5, LLVM, riscv toolchain) live at known paths
# and are NOT duplicated per worktree.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/setup_worktree.sh <purpose> [base-ref]
#
# Examples:
#   scripts/setup_worktree.sh feature                  # off origin/develop, branch feature/scratch
#   scripts/setup_worktree.sh bugfix/issue-198         # off origin/develop, branch bugfix/issue-198
#   scripts/setup_worktree.sh review origin/master     # off origin/master,  branch review/scratch
#
# Result:
#   /workspace/PyTorchSim-<basename(purpose)>           new worktree
#   /workspace/PyTorchSim-<...>/.envrc                  per-worktree env (source it)
#
# After creation:
#   cd /workspace/PyTorchSim-<...>
#   source .envrc
#   (cd PyTorchSimDevice && python setup.py build_ext --inplace)   # build the .so once
