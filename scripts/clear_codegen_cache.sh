# Clear PyTorchSim's codegen caches so the next torch.compile run regenerates
# the wrapper Python and the per-kernel artifacts. Run this whenever you edit
# anything that affects codegen (PyTorchSimFrontend/triton_backend/*,
# PyTorchSimFrontend/tog/*, or pytorchsim-triton-opt) -- otherwise the previous compile is
# replayed byte-for-byte from $TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH and your change appears not
# to take.

# Wipes:
#   $TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH/.torchinductor      (Inductor compile cache, points
#                                            here via TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR
#                                            set in extension_config.py)
#   $TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH/<11-char-hash>/     (per-source wrapper dirs, keyed by
#                                            hash_prefix(src) in
#                                            extension_config.py)
#   $TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH/triton_<hash>/      (per-kernel artifacts: spec,
#                                            staged IR, ELF, trace.so)
#
# WHY THE TRITON ONES MATTER MORE THAN THEY LOOK. That hash is of the INDUCTOR
# SOURCE, so a fix anywhere BELOW it -- a psto pass, triton-shared -- leaves the
# hash alone and the launcher reuses the ELF it already has. Measured: two runs
# of test_transformer.py reported the same divergence while the kernel, given
# the model's own recorded inputs, passed standalone at 2.7e-07; the artifacts
# were a day old. A compiler that moved and a cache that did not is a wrong
# measurement, not a slow one.
#
# Does NOT touch:
#   $TORCHSIM_LOG_PATH (togsim_results/, just simulation logs)
#   Anything outside $TORCHSIM_DUMP_PATH
