"""dep_analysis.py -- dependency-edge analysis for the C++ trace pipeline (sec 10).

The current TOG pass does NO dependency analysis (it emits a lexical loop tree +
runtime tags). This module derives the producer->consumer edges that the explicit
dataflow trace needs, from two sources available on the post-vcix IR (before
build_skeleton collapses the compute regions):

  1. SRAM access: each DMA/compute's read/write SRAM buffer(s), recovered by
     following SSA (a vcix.iv's input vector -> its vector.transfer_read -> the
     memref -> @global), and the DMA's spad operand. Edge: a reader depends on
     the last node that wrote the same buffer.
  2. vcix preload/matmul pairing: a matmul (vcix opcode 0) consumes the weights a
     preceding preload (opcode 1) loaded into the systolic array -- an SA-internal
     dependency NOT visible as a memref access, so it comes from the opcode order.

This is a node-level analysis (one node per build_tog compute/DMA node); the loops
replay the nodes, so loop-carried edges (the Y_spad accumulator) are materialized
per iteration downstream. First cut: buffer granularity (slot-level value matching
is a later refinement). Output is an edge list for validation / to drive emit.
