"""cycle_table: the precomputed tile_id -> (cycle, overlapping_cycle) table the
C++ trace pipeline looks up at runtime (docs/design/togsim_cpp_trace.md sec 6).

A `togsim.compute(tile_id=...)` in the trace says *which* tile to compute, not
how long it takes. Because tiles are fixed size, each tile's cost is invariant
(only the trip count varies with shape), so it is sampled once and stored here,
keyed by `tile_id`. Two numbers per tile, mirroring the legacy TOG:

  * `cycle`            -- full compute latency, sampled by gem5 sample-mode
                          (the existing measurement: `_rewrite_loop_steps` +
                          `_insert_compute_markers` in build_tog, run through
                          CycleSimulator -> the per-tile `cycle_list`).
  * `overlapping_cycle` -- the portion that overlaps the previous instruction in
                          the systolic pipeline; the timing core uses it as
                          `finish = prev.finish + cycle - overlapped` (Core.cc).
                          Derived exactly as the legacy path does
                          (tog_generator.generate_tile_graph):
                              type 0 (VectorCompute)  -> 0
                              type 1 (MatmulCompute)  -> max(cycle - x_offset, 0)
                              type 2 (MatmulPreload)  -> max(cycle - w_offset, 0)

This module only *builds/serializes* the table from a cycle_list; obtaining the
cycle_list reuses the existing sample-mode + gem5 path. The
`tile_id` order matches build_skeleton's `compute_nodes` order, which matches the
legacy TOG, so the same sampling keys both paths.

Requires the MLIR Python bindings (to read the skeleton's togsim.compute ops).
