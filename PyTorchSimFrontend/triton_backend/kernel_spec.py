"""Inductor kernel  ->  tnpu KernelSpec.

Two jobs, both of which exist because Inductor's Triton output is written for a
GPU launcher and tnpu's is written for a static, ahead-of-time pipeline:

1. `collect_meta` -- pull everything tnpu needs out of the Inductor kernel while
   we still have `V.graph`: argument names/roles/dtypes/sizes, the constexprs,
   and the numels the grid is computed from. This runs at codegen time; by the
   time the compile callable fires, `V.graph` is gone.

2. `write_spec_file` -- turn the Triton source + that metadata into a kernel file
   tnpu can load (`tnpu.spec.load_spec`).

WHY THE SOURCE HAS TO BE REWRITTEN
----------------------------------
Inductor emits, above the kernel:

    from torch._inductor.runtime import triton_heuristics
    @triton_heuristics.pointwise(size_hints={'x': 1024}, ..., inductor_meta=...)
    @triton.jit
    def triton_npu_0(in_ptr0, out_ptr0, xnumel, XBLOCK : tl.constexpr):

Neither line can survive into tnpu:

  * the tnpu triton venv has NO torch (deliberately -- tnpu/spec.py), so the
    `torch._inductor.runtime` import fails on sight;
  * `triton_heuristics.pointwise` is the AUTOTUNER. It picks XBLOCK at runtime
    and derives `grid = cdiv(xnumel, XBLOCK)` from it. tnpu needs both to be
    constants: the block size becomes a `tl.constexpr` in the ttir signature and
    the grid is executed as a sequential loop by the generated C wrapper.

So the decorator is stripped and XBLOCK is pinned as a constexpr instead. That is
not a workaround -- fixing the config at codegen time is what makes the kernel
statically describable, which is the whole premise of this route.

    `inplace_buffers` IS NOT THE WHOLE OF `inout`. It holds the case where

    `in_out_ptrN`. A kernel can also mutate a buffer an EARLIER kernel produced,
    and then the argument is an ordinary `out_ptrN` sitting in `output_buffers`
    while `kernel.mutations` names the buffer. Inductor reads all three tables
    when it builds `mutated_arg_names` (codegen/triton.py) and so does this.

    Missing the third one is not a naming detail. An `out` is handed a fresh
    buffer, so a kernel that writes only the positions an index names leaves the
    rest at whatever the fresh buffer held:

    runtime `grid=` callable. Fixing them here is what makes the launch shape
    static.

    THESE ARE SIZES, NOT A LAYOUT. Nothing here chooses which axis lands on the
    lanes, because that is not decided until tnpu's select_lane_axis, several
    passes into the other repo: it gathers what every op demands (a matmul wants
    its last axis on the lanes, a reduction wants the axis it folds off them,
    elementwise operands have to agree), resolves conflicts by flipping the
    matmul, and only defaults to dim 0 when nothing asked. Measured over the
    tnpu dumps: 26 of 36 stamped kernels are axis 0, gemm_fp16_kernel is axis 1
    throughout, and gemm/bmm carry BOTH on different operands of one op.

    THIS USED TO SAY DIM 0 WAS THE LANE AXIS AND THAT A LANE MUST HOLD EXACTLY
    ONE ELEMENT. Both halves were wrong, and the second is why the first looked
    right: pinning the outermost block to the lane count made dim 0 the
    degenerate answer often enough that the claim was never tested. It is tested
    now -- kernels/coverage/tile/tile_deeper_than_one_per_lane.py runs a
    256-wide tile on 128 lanes exactly, and tile_gemm_lane_axis_deeper.py does
    it on the axis a matmul demanded, at 9.54e-06 against a 1.53e-05 control.
    Nine memref<128x256xf32, 1> spad buffers in that kernel's 04-adapted.mlir,
    so the deeper tile is really built and really addressed.

    So the lane count below is a DEFAULT WIDTH -- a tile at least as wide as the
    machine -- and not a requirement the backend would break without. Choosing
    real tile sizes is still the block-size policy gap in README; what has gone
    away is the reason to believe there was only one legal answer.

        A BLOCK BIGGER THAN ITS NUMEL IS NOT FREE, and it used to be handed out
        unconditionally. `t.sum(dim=0)` on a [128, 64] tensor gives xnumel 64
        against XBLOCK 128, so the tile is twice the iteration space and the
        surplus is carried by a mask -- whose rank-1 index rows are then
        stranded ONE_LANE while the data is banked across the lanes, and stage 4
        stops:

            NotVectorisable: one operand of this elementwise op is in a single
            bank (ONE_LANE) while another is banked across the lanes on
            iteration dim 0 of extent 128

        `sum(dim=1)` on the same tensor has xnumel 128 against the same XBLOCK,
        needs no mask at all, and comes back at 1.907e-06. So the axis was never
        the difference; the block overshooting its numel was.

        Rounded UP to a power of two because `tl.arange` needs one, so a numel
        of 100 still gets 128 and still needs its mask -- that one is real.

        AND THE BACKEND'S SIDE IS NARROWER THAN ITS MESSAGE. A hand-written tnpu
        kernel that reduces over the banked axis with a block deliberately wider
        than the extent -- [128, 64] data under a [128, 128] block, so the mask
        genuinely fires -- COMPILES AND IS EXACT. Written with the block equal
        to the extent it also passes, because a trivially true mask folds away
        before stage 4 sees it. So the refusal above is not "a mask over a
        banked axis" in general, and no coverage kernel was added for it: one
        that passes either way pins nothing. What is measured is this: the
        oversized block was the whole observable, and clamping it is the fix.

def clamp_instead_of_wrap(body, kernel_name=""):
    """Replace the mm/bmm templates' `rm % M` / `rn % N` with a load mask.

    WHAT THE WRAP IS FOR. `rm = pid_m * BLOCK_M + arange(BLOCK_M)` runs past M
    whenever BLOCK_M does not divide M, so the last program addresses rows that
    do not exist. The template folds them back to the top of the matrix with
    `% M` and lets the store's mask discard whatever they computed. On a GPU
    that is the right trade: no branch, no fault, and reading garbage is free.

    WHAT IT COSTS HERE. A modulo on a pointer index is not a stride, so the
    descriptor stops being one: triton-shared marks it (`static_shape != 0`) and
    tnpu lowers it as an INDIRECT transfer -- a per-element index tile with the
    wrapped dim's stride set to 0. Three bills follow.

      the index tile is real scratchpad, in i64, the shape of the operand --
      TWICE the bytes of an f32 tile, and both operands are wrapped, so a
      three-tile kernel stages five. Measured on a 512x512x512 addmm with a
      residual: 73760 bytes/lane against a 65536 budget, refused at link.

      a gather is element-by-element where a descriptor is a burst.

      and it is where the wrong numbers are. Measured on the SAME kernel with
      only this changed: 512x512x512 at BM/BN = 256 answers 110.93 with the wrap
      and 5.34e-05 without, at the same tile and the same 2x2 grid.

    THE ANSWER IS THE ONE THIS BACKEND ALREADY USES ON THE OTHER SIDE. The store
    in the very same kernel does not fold, it CLAMPS:

        mask = (idx_m < M) & (idx_n < N)
        tl.store(out_ptr0 + xindex, acc, mask)

    which lowers to `tts.store`'s `static_mask_dims` and then to a transfer with
    `masked_axes` / `masked_fill = 0`. PyTorchSim's MLIR route answers the same
    question the same way on BOTH sides -- `def_dma_op` clamps each tile dim to
    the real DRAM extent and zero-fills past it, and its gemm template contains
    no modulo at all. The Triton route was the asymmetric one: clamping stores
    and folding loads.

    So the wrap goes and the loads get the matching bound. Out-of-range rows
    read 0 instead of a folded row, contribute 0 to the dot product, and land in
    output rows the store's mask already discards -- the same values are kept,
    by construction.

    A DIVIDING BLOCK NEEDS NEITHER. `gemm_combination_mapping` picks tiles from
    the DIVISORS of the shape, so rm runs 0..M-1 and both the wrap and the mask
    are dead; the wrap is dropped and no mask is added, which is what keeps the
    common case a bare descriptor.

    Torch's template already reasons this way about K -- `EVEN_K` skips the K
    mask -- and simply does not for M and N. This supplies the missing half.
