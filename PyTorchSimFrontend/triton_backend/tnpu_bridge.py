"""Run the triton-npu pipeline, out of process.

WHY A SUBPROCESS
----------------
tnpu's passes run on LLVM 23's MLIR python bindings; this process holds LLVM 20's
(TORCHSIM_LLVM_PATH). `mlir` ships without an `__init__.py`, so it is a NAMESPACE
package whose `__path__` is the union of every `mlir/` directory on sys.path --
two LLVMs in one interpreter silently merge and fail later with an AttributeError
from a generated dialect module (tnpu/config.py:activate_bindings documents the
exact failure). They cannot share an interpreter, so tnpu gets its own.

The seam between them is a FILE, which is measured to work: LLVM 23 prints the
IR, and LLVM 20's bindings parse it back without complaint (verified by feeding
tnpu's 04-custom.mlir to PyTorchSim's build_tog). That is what makes the split
viable rather than merely necessary.

    config.py holds DEFAULTS for the same quantities so it can run standalone.
    Two copies of a number with no direction between them drift, and these
    already have: the YAML says 128 KB of scratchpad per lane while tnpu's
    default is 64 KB, so a reduction block sized against one and linked against
    the other died at LINK time with an error naming the scratchpad rather than
    the block size.

    Reading the YAML here is only half of that. `tnpu_env` below hands the same
    numbers to every tnpu subprocess through the environment variables its
    config.py already reads, so changing the YAML changes what the compiler
    targets instead of only changing what this side believes. That is the half
    that makes them one number rather than two that happen to agree.

    pointing at LLVM 20's mlir_core is picked up before tnpu's own
    activate_bindings() runs, and the two LLVMs merge silently.

    The device backend autoload goes for the same reason, one layer down. tnpu
    imports torch only as CPU numerics (from_numpy, matmul, allclose) and never
    names `npu`, but `import torch` would still autoload whichever
    PyTorchSimDevice the editable install records -- which is one worktree's,
    while TORCHSIM_DIR below points the frontend at another's. That pairing is
    what a second worktree makes possible, and it fails as an unrelated
    ModuleNotFoundError from inside torch's autoload. The subprocess does not
    need the device, so it does not load it.

    The three TNPU_* names are the ones tnpu/config.py reads for exactly these
    quantities, so this is telling it rather than overriding it. Anything the
    caller already set in the environment wins, which keeps the pinned-worktree
    workflow (TNPU_SPAD_SIZE=... for a one-off experiment) working.
