"""The functional half of the Triton route: real tensors -> Spike -> real tensors.

The timing half (timing.py) tells you how long the kernel takes; this tells you
whether it computed the right thing. tnpu's stage 6 already runs the ELF under
Spike, but on inputs it generates itself. Here the launch's own tensors are
written as the `.raw` files stage 6 reads, and the outputs are copied back:

    run(workdir, meta, args)    args -> runtime/*.raw -> spike -> args

The binary is shape-specialised -- the spec bakes the grid, the scalar values and
the memref extents in -- so a launch whose shapes differ from the compiled ones
is rejected rather than silently run against the wrong bounds.
