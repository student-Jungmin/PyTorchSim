    one), while the program-id arguments are always laid out x, y, z. The two
    are zipped downstream, so the argument list is built per axis rather than as
    a range.

    A TEMPLATE KERNEL'S AXIS COUNT IS NOT IN ITS NUMELS, which is the same thing
    kernel_spec.grid_xyz has to say about the extents. mm and conv come from a
    jinja template whose grid is over output tiles; Inductor still hands them a
    numels dict, and it describes the pointwise iteration space rather than that
    grid. Counting axes from it gives 1 for every template kernel.

    That is right often enough to hide: an mm at 128x128 has template grid
    (16, 1, 1), so one axis is the true answer and the numels agree by accident.
    A bmm does not -- measured on tests/ops/fusion/test_prologue_fusion.py,
    triton_npu_fused_add_bmm_mul_4 has template grid (256, 4, 1) while its
    numels hold a single xnumel. One pid argument was replaced and the other was
    left, and _rewrite_signature refuses a kernel argument that still has uses:

        ValueError: kernel arg still used after build_skeleton; cannot drop it

    with %arg6 feeding remsi/divsi (the pid decomposition) and %arg7 feeding
    muli by 262144 (the batch stride). Both allowlist failures on this route,
    test_gqa and test_prologue_fusion, are bmm template kernels dying there.

    So the template's own grid decides the count when it has one, and the numels
    do otherwise. The extents still are not compiled in -- only the COUNT has to
    be, and the launch knows the rest -- so this reads the length and nothing
