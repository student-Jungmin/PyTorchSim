"""Compile cache for the Triton route -- the counterpart of extension_codecache.

`triton_npu_compile` is what the generated wrapper calls, exactly where the MLIR
route calls `custom_async_compile.mlir(...)`. It compiles the Triton kernel via
tnpu and returns the callable the wrapper then invokes per launch.

    define_kernel   ->  triton_npu_compile(src, meta, kernel_name)  ->  launcher
    call site       ->  launcher(arg0, arg1, ..., xnumel)

Layout mirrors the MLIR route so the two are comparable: one directory per source
hash under the dump path, holding the generated tnpu kernel file and every tnpu
artifact (01-ttir.mlir ... *-<kernel>.elf).

def _shrink_tile(meta, usage, budget):
    """Divide the tile by enough to fit, in place. False if stuck.

    WHY THE BLOCK SIZE IS THE FREE VARIABLE AND THE BUFFER COUNT IS NOT.
    `fixed_config_for` sizes R0_BLOCK against a budget divided by
    `_REDUCTION_LIVE_TILES`, a constant standing in for how many block-sized
    tiles the kernel will keep live -- and that count is a property of the
    LOWERING, which does not exist until the block size has been chosen. The
    constant's own comment says so ("the count is a property of the kernel and
    not a constant") and then guesses anyway, at 12. ViT's first LayerNorm,
    fused with a patch convolution, an addmm and a transpose, lowers to 41
    scratchpad globals:

        R0_BLOCK 512   77504 bytes/lane   over the 65536 budget
        R0_BLOCK 256   38680             fits
        R0_BLOCK 128   19356

    So the guess cannot be made right by picking a bigger number -- 41 would
    cost every ordinary reduction three quarters of its tile. It can only be
    CORRECTED, and the correction is one recompile: tnpu measures the real
    thing and says by how much.

    `usage / budget` rounded up to a power of two, so an overshoot of 1.18x
    halves once and an overshoot of 5x goes straight to an eighth rather than
    walking there. A reduction block moves first: XBLOCK is usually the lane
    axis, and shrinking it would leave lanes idle without freeing a byte.

    ONLY A BLOCK THE KERNEL ACCEPTS AS AN ARGUMENT MOVES ANYTHING. A PERSISTENT
    reduction -- Inductor's choice when r0_numel is small enough to hold the
    whole reduction in one tile -- writes the block size into the kernel BODY:

        @triton_heuristics.persistent_reduction(size_hints={'x': 1024, 'r0_': 128})
        def triton_npu_fused_..._5(..., XBLOCK : tl.constexpr):
            R0_BLOCK: tl.constexpr = 128        # <- not an argument

    so R0_BLOCK is absent from the signature and rewriting it here changes the
    spec, recompiles, and produces THE SAME KERNEL. Measured on Qwen3's fused
    q_norm + rope (`_unsafe_view_add_cat_mean_mul_neg_pow_rsqrt_slice_...`, 27
    scratchpad globals over a [XBLOCK, 128] tile), where the loop used to run
    down to R0_BLOCK 1 and fail with the overflow unchanged at every step:

        R0_BLOCK 128 -> 8 -> 1   1625120 bytes/lane, all three, over 131072
        XBLOCK   128 -> 64        fits (and 16 and 8 also compile)

    In that kernel the reduction axis is the vectorised one -- tnpu names the
    globals `bufN_spad_1lane` and Inductor scores the tiling `{'x': 0,
    'r0_': 2655744}` -- so X is the tile's outer axis and shrinking it is
    exactly what frees bytes per lane. Hence: reduction blocks if the kernel
    takes any, XBLOCK only when it takes none, and never both.
