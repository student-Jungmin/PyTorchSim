    THE MAPPING IS PyTorchSim's OWN, not a table. `gemm_combination_mapping`
    enumerates every tile that is a multiple of the lane count and whose three
    operands fit half the scratchpad -- half because the tiles are double
    buffered -- checking the total AND the per-lane footprint, and ranks them by
    scratchpad used, descending. That is rule 6's enumerate-rank-select over the
    quantity that actually limits this machine, and it is the same call the MLIR
    route's gemm and bmm templates make, so the two routes now answer the tile
    question once (mlir_common.BaseMLIRHardwareInfo).

    WHAT IT REPLACES: torch's generic set, whose first entry is
    GemmConfig(64, 64, 16) for f32 -- sized for a GPU's shared memory and warp
    tiling, both of which this machine has neither of. Nothing in it knows the
    lane count or the scratchpad, so the tile it picked was right only by
    accident, and the TODO saying so had been in this file since it was written.

    ONE THING THE MLIR ROUTE DOES NOT NEED, AND IT IS TRITON'S: a block size
    reaches `tl.arange` and `tl.dot`, so it must be a power of two and at least
    16. `gemm_combination_mapping` pads to multiples of 8 or of the lane count
    and multiplies by divisors, so 384 and 104 are both reachable and neither is
    a legal Triton block. They are dropped rather than rounded -- rounding up
    breaks the scratchpad budget the mapping just proved, and rounding down
    hands back a tile nothing enumerated.

    The generic set is appended after them, never before: a shape whose every
    mapped tile is an illegal block size still has to compile, and `pick_config`
    takes the first offered, so a tail is a fallback rather than a competitor.

    NO CAP ON THE TILE SIZE. There was one, at the lane count, and this
    docstring called it a fact about the machine. It never was: it was two
    defects wearing one sentence, and it took five wrong guesses to get there.

    THE WRAP. Measured on triton-npu, one thing at a time on the same
    512x512x512 kernel:

        wrap, 2x2 grid, (256, 256, 512)     110.93 off
        NO wrap, 2x2 grid, (256, 256, 512)  5.34e-05
        no wrap, one program, 256 cube      3.81e-05

    so neither the wide tile nor the grid was ever the fault, and the array
    instructions come out as the same 2 x 4 x 2 loop nest either way.
    `kernel_spec.clamp_instead_of_wrap` removes it -- and reaching the BMM
    spelling of it, `tl.load(A)` against mm's `tl.load(A + (xindex))`, is what
    took tests/ops/fusion/test_prologue_fusion.py from 127.39 off to passing.

    THE BIAS. Running each suspect alone at BLOCK_N = 512, M = 32, K = 768,
    N = 1536:

        matmul(a, b)             6.96e-05
        matmul(a, bt.t())        5.53e-05
        addmm(bias, a, b)        5.84        <-- the bias
        addmm(bias, a, bt.t())   5.84

    An addmm epilogue loads its bias through a BROADCAST pointer tensor, and
    triton_shared's PtrAnalysis rewrote every op on the way to it except the
    broadcast, so the load found no descriptor at [BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N] and fell to
    a gather -- which then wrote each lane's one fetched value into both of the
    slots that lane owns. Fixed upstream by `PtrAnalysis::rewriteBroadcastOp`;
    the transfer comes out `dram_stride = [0, 1]` with no gather.

    Both reproducers live in triton-npu:
    kernels/coverage/tile/tile_bias_row_deeper_than_one_per_lane.py for the
    second, and tile_gemm_wide_tile_grid.py for a REAL gather at a lane depth
    above one -- which is still red, and which this route no longer reaches
    because it no longer makes gathers it does not need.

    What is left is a size, not a layout: BLOCK_N takes the lane count because a
    tile should be at least as wide as the machine, and M and K cost scratchpad
    rather than lanes, so they are offered small-to-large and the first the

                   In the first, blocks 1..7 of axis 1 hold `idx_y_c` >= 128
                   against a bound of 1 -- 6720 of 7680 programs do literally
                   nothing, and the simulator runs every one.

    IT IS A CORRECTNESS-PRESERVING FIX AND NOT A HEURISTIC. The programs removed
    are exactly those whose stores are masked off in full, so the output is the
    same tensor; what changes is how many times the machine is asked to produce
    nothing. GROUPS == 1 is untouched -- there `GROUP_OUT_C` IS `OUT_C` and the
    two expressions are the same number.

    PATCHED ON THE TEMPLATE, not on the module. `conv2d_template` captured the
    function at construction, so rebinding `conv.conv2d_grid` alone changes
    nothing that runs; the object's own attribute is what the launcher reads.

    THE LEVER THE SCRATCHPAD RETRY PULLS IS THE BLOCK, and a persistent

    power of two above the extent>` INTO the generated source, so
    `kernel_spec.fixed_config_for`'s answer is never read and
    `codecache._shrink_reduction_blocks` halves a number the kernel does not
    consult.

    MEASURED, BERT-small kernel 0 (three embedding gathers + the first
    LayerNorm, r0_numel 768, 21 scratchpad globals). Inductor calls 768
    persistent -- it is under the INNER threshold of 1024 -- and bakes
    R0_BLOCK 1024. The retry then recompiles EIGHT TIMES, 128 -> 64 -> 32 ->
    16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, and the measurement does not move by one byte:

        70944 bytes/lane over a budget of 65536, retrying with R0_BLOCK 128
        70944 ...                                                       64
        70944 ...                              32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

    then `blocks` is empty and it re-raises. With persistence declined the same
    kernel compiles on the FIRST try at our own block of 512.

    THE RULE IS THE ONE FACT, NOT A HEURISTIC: persist iff the persistent block
    IS the block we would have pinned. Equal, and nothing is given up -- the
    kernel gets the size we wanted and Inductor writes the two-pass form that
    needs no Welford. Bigger, and persisting trades our only correction for a
    tile we already know does not fit. BERT-tiny (extent 128, our block 128)
    keeps persistence and its numbers; BERT-small (extent 768, next power of
    two 1024, our block 512) loses it, which is the point.

    THIS IS THE DOCUMENTED HOOK, NOT A MONKEYPATCH -- rule 16.
    `torch._inductor.config.inductor_choices_class` names the class
    `virtualized._choices_default` instantiates, and virtualized.py says what it
    is for in as many words: "We virtualize InductorChoices to allow changing
    inductor heuristics from out of tree." An earlier version of this file
    forced persistence by REBINDING `InductorChoices.should_use_persistent_
    reduction`, and the comment that removed it called that out as the thing
    rule 16 forbids. The decision is the inverse of that one and the wiring is
    not the same wiring.

    append and falls to `extern_kernels.convolution` -- which on npu raises
    `convolution_overrideable not implemented`. That is what stops
    RecurrentGemma's Griffin block, whose temporal conv is an `nn.Conv1d`.

    The rewrite itself is torch's own: `conv1d_to_conv2d` sits in
