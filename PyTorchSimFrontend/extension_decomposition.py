"""Decompositions that follow from what the DEVICE can do, not from codegen.

A decomposition that belongs to the codegen backend lives beside it, in
triton_backend/. This module is for the other kind: an op that has to be
rewritten because of what running on this device MEANS.

An op with no `npu` kernel falls back, and the fallback runs on the CPU. So the
set of ops this device supports is ATen's CPU set, and where that set is
narrower than the CUDA one, a model written for CUDA arrives with a call this
device cannot make. That is a device-level statement and this is where it goes.

    """`polar` as a VIEW over a real pair, so it never leaves the graph.

    Not a dtype problem like histc above -- a layout one, and the layout is
    decided by a hop that never reaches the CPU kernel. `aten::polar` is
    CompositeExplicitAutograd, so it is registered for THIS backend too and
    beats the boxed fallback: the composite runs here, allocates the result
    itself, and only then calls `aten::polar.out`, which is what the fallback
    sees. Measured, on a transposed input:

        aten::polar     out stride (1024, 32, 1)   contiguous
        aten::polar.out into a permuted out        (1024, 1, 32), kept
        cpu   torch.polar                          (1024, 1, 32)

    So the fallback is fine and the allocation is not. Inductor's meta models
    what a real backend does -- TensorIterator carries the operands'
    permutation into the output -- and gets

        assert_size_stride(buf14, (1, 32, 32), (1024, 1, 32),
                           'torch.ops.aten.polar.default')
        AssertionError: expected size 32==32, stride 32==1 at dim=1

    NOTHING ELSE ON THIS DEVICE LOSES THE PERMUTATION. mul, add and exp keep it
    (measured, npu against cpu, all three), and so do sinh and erfinv, which
    reach the fallback as functional ops and let the CPU kernel choose. It is
    the composite-with-a-fallback-out path alone.

    WHICH IS WHY THIS DOES NOT TRY TO FIX THE LAYOUT. Rewriting polar as
    `complex(abs*cos, abs*sin)` moved the identical assertion one op over, to
    `aten.complex.default` -- also composite, also allocating its own output.
    The answer is to stop having an extern call at all: build the pair with
    ops this backend compiles and let `view_as_complex` name it, which Inductor
    already treats as a view over real data. DeepSeek-V2's own RoPE proves the
    point -- its `view_as_complex` is fused into ordinary `*fp32` kernels
    (triton_npu_fused__unsafe_view_split_with_sizes_transpose_view_view_as_complex_5).

    `.contiguous()` IS LOAD-BEARING: view_as_complex wants the last dimension
    to have stride 1, and a stack over permuted operands does not
    ("RuntimeError: Tensor must have a last dimension with stride 1"). It is
    one real copy, on the device, in place of a CPU round trip.
